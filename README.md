# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! This repository highlights my hands-on experience with web application security testing using platforms like PortSwigger Web Security Academy. It showcases my ability to identify, exploit, and explain common vulnerabilities aligned with the OWASP Top 10 — with a focus on Burp Suite and manual testing techniques.
