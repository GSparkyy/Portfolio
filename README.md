# üîß Security+ & IT Support Projects Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my hands-on experience in cybersecurity fundamentals, vulnerability testing, and IT support practices. Through labs, simulations, and write-ups, I demonstrate practical knowledge aligned with CompTIA Security+ and Burp Suite Certified Practitioner domains. Projects span web application testing, incident response exercises, and basic network troubleshooting.
